# Gradle Build Tool roadmap

## About this repository

The goal of this project is to provide a high-level overview of the Gradle Build Tool roadmap. Major engineering projects and user-facing features are captured as GitHub issues, which only Gradle staff can create or update. You can subscribe to this repository to get updates about the current projects. You can also see the status of each item on the [board](https://github.com/orgs/gradle/projects/31/views/1).

The board also shows the past two quarters so that you can see what was delivered in recent Gradle releases.

Many smaller improvements and bug fixes are made in every Gradle release. See the [issue tracker](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues), [milestones](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/milestones), and [release notes](https://gradle.org/releases/) for details.

## Feedback

Comments on the roadmap board itself are disabled to keep it neat and tidy. Instead, reach out to us on the [community Slack](https://gradle-community.slack.com) #roadmap channel.
